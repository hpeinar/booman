Bomberman in html5

Changelog
==
<strong>v0.6 (upcoming)</strong>
- map generation is now seeded using David Bau's script (see credits)

<strong>v0.5</strong>
- introduced camera. Board size is currently 60 * 60 tiles to test camera out
- fixed a bug where space wasn't removed from keyqueue when no bombs were left to place

<strong>v0.4.1</strong>
- made a background canvas for drawing grass just one time, instead of every time on update. Removed CSS background.

<strong>v0.4</strong>
- introduced floating texts. Info texts are shown on bonus pickup and death
- player now spawns onto a random tile (reduces the risk of spawning into a wall or no-way-out position)

<strong>v0.3</strong>
- grass tiles are no longer drawn, background is set with CSS
- player movement is now "animated" meaning that after the key click, player is locked into the animation for 4 updates
- update rate changed from 50 to 25

<strong>v0.2</strong>
- introduced spritesheet
- player is now the same size as every other tile
- fixed moving check

<strong>v0.1</strong>
- first release

Little about it:
==
- ~1000 lines of js (v0.5)
- took me around 2 weeks, after the work development time to create (v0.1)
- everything is written in OOP style, so all the things are objects which have their own properties and methods
- Game update and draw functions are called every 25ms
- Input is handled using queue system. All keystrokes are put into an queue which is handled on the game update. This should give pretty responsive gameplay.
- Sprites are drawn using <a href="http://calebevans.me/projects/jcanvas/index.php" title="jCanvas">jCanvas</a>.
- It has no levels, so after blowing all the blocks up there is nothing else to do.
- Map generation is now seeded (as of v0.6)
- It's missing sprite pre-loading, so you might see some flickering with the images.
- It is possible that you spawn on a wall and cannot move, either blow yourself up with the wall or just refresh to get new map
